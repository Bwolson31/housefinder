## Description 

This website was initially developed to be a dashboard for prospective homebuyers, looking to buy a house in a different city. We intended to use the Zillow API and Google Maps API for this to work. Users would be able to type into a modal 5 cities they are thinking about moving to, at which point they would execute the search, and there would be a display of zillow stats about these five cities, including average housing price. Users would be able to click on these zillow stats and a Google map of that city would pop up beneath it. However, as far as we can tell, the data for Zillow API isn't usable until 10 days have passed. And unfortunately, we discovered this too late, so what we have is a half-working website. 


## Installation 
N/A


## Usage
To use this website, type in the name of upt to 5 cities in the modal, pressing the search button after each city. Afterwards, press the Execute button. Then, presumably, everything should work. 

## Credits 

Credits go to myself--Brian Olson, Jade Haney, Kyle Schoenberger, and James Burwell. Credit also goes to the Google Maps API and possibly, one day, the Zillow API.
